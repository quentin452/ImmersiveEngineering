ie.manual.entry.updateNews_20=Dear Engineer!<br><br>The past update has brought some new features and changes to Immersive Engineering:<br><br>A new variation of scaffolding was invented, that replaces the unsafe, open steel struts on the top with some wooden planks. Aluminium has turned out to be quite useful for decorative purposes, as such, fences and scaffolding have now been made available in your local Engineer's shop.
ie.manual.entry.updateNews_21=A new kind of <link;breaker;§o§nbreakerswitch§r;2> was invented to be controlled with redstone signals and accept HV lines. Subsequently, HV lines are now forbidden from being attached to normal breakers, due to lifethreatening voltages. We don't want trouble with the union.

ie.manual.entry.updateNews_3.name=What's new in v0.6.3
ie.manual.entry.updateNews_3.subtext=Old, new; borrowed and Blu
ie.manual.entry.updateNews_30=Dear Engineer!<br><br>The past update has brought some new features and changes to Immersive Engineering:<br><br>After suffering a severe concussion, Chief Engineer Adams drafted plans for the <link;chemthrower;§o§nChemical §o§nThrower§r>, a device that allows you to spray any fluid anywhere. It also features a built-in pilot light to ignite the fluid spray. We think Adams might be insane.
ie.manual.entry.updateNews_31=Another new invention of the research department is the <link;chargingStation;§o§nCharging §o§nStation§r>, which allows you to insert energy into items and charge them up.<br>Assistant Engineer "Cobra" has presented his newest invention, the <link;conveyor;§o§nDropping §o§nConveyor§r;2>, which drops items passing over it into inventories below.<br>To top it all off the <link;sorter;§o§nItem §o§nRouter§r> has had its interface designed to allow for OreDictionary-, NBT-based and Fuzzy filtering of items!

ie.manual.entry.updateNews_33=Finally, the financial department has been hassling us for not keeping track of our power usage. After a heated argument, the have presented us with the blueprints for the <link;eMeter;§o§nCurrent §o§nTransformer§r>, a device that can measure the energy flowing through it. Needless to say they are even less happy now that they know how much energy an Arc Furnace really consumes.

ie.manual.entry.updateNews_4.name=What's new in v0.6.4
ie.manual.entry.updateNews_4.subtext=Old, new; borrowed and Blu
ie.manual.entry.updateNews_40=Dear Engineer!<br><br>The past update has brought only little changes.<br>The energy transmission is fixed again, the engineer it that broke has been dunked into cold water as punishment.<br>The <link;furnaceHeater;§o§nFurnace §o§nHeater§r> has seen some improvements that now allow it to heat up Alchemical Furnaces from Thaumcraft or Evaporators from Cutting Edge.<br><br>That's all for now, let's hope it stays sufficiently stable.

ie.manual.entry.updateNews_5.name=What's new in v0.7.0
ie.manual.entry.updateNews_5.subtext=Old, new; borrowed and Blu
ie.manual.entry.updateNews_50=Dear Engineer!<br><br>The new version of IE you are playing features some major changes compared to previous versions!<br>A new component has been added in the form of <link;plates;§o§nMetal §o§nPlates§r>. These plates don't entirely replace ingots, but are necessary for a few recipes. Plates can be made with an Engineer's Hammer or in a <link;metalPress;§o§nMetal §o§nPress§r>.
ie.manual.entry.updateNews_51=Among the uses for these new plates is the creation of the <link;improvedBlastfurnace;§o§nImproved §o§nBlast §o§nFurnace§r> out of Reinforced Blast Bricks. This new Blast Furnace is a much faster way of creating steel and automateable. The "old" Blast Furnace has been aptly named <link;blastfurnace;§o§nCrude §o§nBlast §o§nFurnace§r> and cannot be automated. Both Furnaces create slag now.<br>The <link;arcfurnace;§o§nArc §o§nFurnace§r> has also seen a rebalance to go along with this. Its steel costs being reduced and instead using reinforced blast bricks, making it a direct upgrade.

#導入(Introduction)
ie.manual.entry.introduction.name=導入
ie.manual.entry.introduction.subtext=Getting into Engineering

ie.manual.entry.introduction0=Greetings, fellow engineer, and welcome to Immersive Engineering. This journal shall serve as your guide for setting up all the new machines and functions this mod has to offer.<br>Let's start with the basics first: Immersive Engineering is built around the concept of retrofuturistic generation and transfer of energy. The energy used in this mod is Redstone Flux, a trait shared with many other mods currently available.
ie.manual.entry.introduction1=Energy is transmitted between §lconnectors§r by the use of §lwires§r. Wires can only bridge a limited distance of blocks, so you will need to use more connectors as §lrelays§r between the wires.<br>You have the choice between three different types of wire, which differ in transferrates, <config;iA;cableTransferRate;l3> RF/tick. To switch between different types of wire, you will need to use §ltransformers§r.

ie.manual.entry.introductionHammer=The Engineer's Hammer is the most important tool at your disposal. It will be used to form multiblocks like the Coke Oven and Blast Furnace<config;b;crushingOreRecipe;, crushing ores into dust ; >or configuring blocks like Wooden Posts.

#鉱石(Ores)
ie.manual.entry.ores.name=鉱石
ie.manual.entry.ores.subtext=Diggy diggy hole

ie.manual.entry.oresCopper=§lCopper Ore§r is found in the world between layers <config;iA;ore_copper;1> and <config;iA;ore_copper;2>, and requires a Stone Pickaxe to harvest.<br><br>The ore will smelt into copper ingots, which are used in crafting basic copper wires, coils, and other integral parts of the IE architecture.
ie.manual.entry.oresBauxite=§lBauxite Ore§r is found in the world between layers <config;iA;ore_bauxite;1> and <config;iA;ore_bauxite;2>, and requires a Stone Pickaxe to harvest.<br><br>The ore will smelt into aluminium ingots, which, together with steel, are used to create high-voltage wires.
ie.manual.entry.oresLead=§lLead Ore§r is found in the world between layers <config;iA;ore_lead;1> and <config;iA;ore_lead;2>, and requires an Iron Pickaxe to harvest.<br><br>The ore will smelt into lead ingots, which are used in creating capacitors.
ie.manual.entry.oresSilver=§lSilver Ore§r is found in the world between layers <config;iA;ore_silver;1> and <config;iA;ore_silver;2>, and requires an Iron Pickaxe to harvest.<br><br>The ore will smelt into silver ingots, which alloy with gold to create electrum, a far more effective conductor.
ie.manual.entry.oresNickel=§lNickel Ore§r is found in the world between layers <config;iA;ore_nickel;1> and <config;iA;ore_nickel;2>, and requires an Iron Pickaxe to harvest.<br><br>The ore will smelt into nickel ingots, which alloy with copper to create constantan, a heat resistant conductor used in the creation of <link;generator;§o§nThermoelectric §o§nGenerators§r;1>.

#鉱石処理(Ore Processing)
ie.manual.entry.oreProcessing.name=鉱石処理
ie.manual.entry.oreProcessing.subtext=

ie.manual.entry.oreProcessing0=Crafting<config;b;crushingOreRecipe;ores and> ingots with a hammer allows you to crush them into dusts. This dust can be resmelted into ingots, but even more importantly, is used to create alloys.<config;b;crushingOreRecipe;<br>Crushing ores with the hammer will yield two dusts, effectively doubling your gain of ingots from ore.>
ie.manual.entry.oreProcessing1=Mixing dusts creates an alloy blend that can then be smelted into alloyed ingots. Constantan has thermo-electric properties and is used in creating the <link;generator;§o§nthermoelectric §o§ngenerator§r;1> and electrum is an excellent electric conductor used in <link;wiring;§o§nmedium-voltage §o§narchitecture§r>.

#合金(Alloys)
ie.manual.entry.alloys.name=合金
ie.manual.entry.alloys.subtext=
ie.manual.entry.alloys0=Mixing dusts creates an alloy blend that can then be smelted into alloyed ingots. Constantan has thermo-electric properties and is used in creating the <link;generator;§o§nthermoelectric §o§ngenerator§r;1> and electrum is an excellent electric conductor used in <link;wiring;§o§nmedium-voltage §o§narchitecture§r>.

#工業用大麻(Industrial Hemp)
ie.manual.entry.hemp.name=工業用大麻
ie.manual.entry.hemp.subtext=530 fabric it

ie.manual.entry.hemp0=Industrial Hemp is a remarkable plant! Not only are its seeds useful for the the creation of <link;biodiesel;§o§nBiodiesel§r>, the hemp fibers are also vital in the creation of <link;generator;§o§nImproved §o§nWindmills§r;3>. The seeds can be gathered by breaking tall grass.

#コークス炉(Coke Oven)
ie.manual.entry.cokeoven.name=コークス炉
ie.manual.entry.cokeoven.subtext=Hot topic!

ie.manual.entry.cokeoven0=The Coke Oven is the first important machine you will need to create in order to proceed with Immersive Engineering. It's functionality is simple, it will heat up coal or blocks of coal without supplying it with oxygen, creating Coal Coke, a carbon rich fuel. More importantly, this process creates §lCreosote Oil§r, which is used as a <link;treatedwood;§o§npreservative §o§nfor §o§nwood§r>. Similarly you can also burn wooden logs into charcoal with this oven, albeit with a smaller yield of creosote.

ie.manual.entry.cokeovenBlock=To form a Coke Oven, arrange 27 of these blocks in a 3x3x3 cube, and rightclick one of the sides' center blocks with an Engineer's Hammer.<br>See the following page for a diagram.

#含浸木材(Treated Wood)
ie.manual.entry.treatedwood.name=含浸木材
ie.manual.entry.treatedwood.subtext=Highly Durable

ie.manual.entry.treatedwood0=Treated Wood is, quite simply, wooden planks covered in creosote oil. It is however, one of the most important materials you will be using in Immersive Engineering, so you'd better be prepared to create a lot of it.

ie.manual.entry.treatedwoodPost0=Posts made from treated wood make for excellent attachment points for your Wire Connectors. They are 4 blocks high, so you won't be able to place them without the proper clearance.<br>Using the hammer on the sides of the topmost block will attach an arm to the post.
ie.manual.entry.treatedwoodPost1=You can also place <link;wiring;§o§ntransformers§r;3> on the pole, which makes it less obtrusive.<br>Placing blocks below the arms of the wooden post will flip the arms upside down.

#コンクリート(Concrete)
ie.manual.entry.concrete.name=コンクリート
ie.manual.entry.concrete.subtext=Fortess Material
ie.manual.entry.concrete0=Concrete is a very hard and resistant composite material. It's cheap to craft and makes for an excellent use for the excess slag produced by the <link;arcfurnace;§n§oArc §n§oFurnace§r>.

#支持気球(Balloon)
ie.manual.entry.balloon.name=支持気球
ie.manual.entry.balloon.subtext=...just make 99 of them
ie.manual.entry.balloon0=Balloons are sacks of fabric with a heatsource below to keep them afloat. They will also emit light, but despite the torch, they are not a fire hazard.<br>Balloons can be placed like normal blocks, or, when no block is targeted, they will be placed in the air infront of you.
ie.manual.entry.balloon1=Similar to <link;metalconstruction;§o§nStructural §o§nConnectors§r;5>, you can attach Hemp Rope and Steel Cable to the balloon.<br>Sneak-clicking allows you to set a height offset for the balloon, allowing you to place it up to 5 blocks above the target.<br>You can also use dyes on a placed balloon; which part you dye depends on where you target it.<br>Rightclicking with an Engineer's Hammer will toggle the balloon's design between horizontal or vertical stripes.

#クレート(Wooden Storage Crate)
ie.manual.entry.crate.name=クレート
ie.manual.entry.crate.subtext=Move that gear up!
ie.manual.entry.crate0=Wooden storage crates are blocks quite similar to a chest. Crafted with treated wood, they offer 27 slots of storage, however, when broken, they will keep that storage, allowing you to move them together with their contents.<br>Like chests, they will output a comparator signal based on the amount of items stored.

#木樽(Wooden Barrel)
ie.manual.entry.barrel.name=木樽
ie.manual.entry.barrel.subtext=Doesn't roll
ie.manual.entry.barrel0=Wooden barrels are simple containers that can store fluid. They will store up to 12 buckets, but because they are wooden, they can't store any gasses or hot fluids.<br>Rightclicking the top or bottom side of the barrel with a Hammer will switch between in-, output or no connection.

#ジェリー缶(Jerry Can)
ie.manual.entry.jerrycan.name=ジェリー缶
ie.manual.entry.jerrycan.subtext=Better than buckets
ie.manual.entry.jerrycan0=Jerrycans are simple metal containers used to carry fluids. They can store up to 10 buckets and can pour that fluid into the world as well as into machines. They can not pick up fluids. Additionally, they can be used to refill other fluid-consuming items like the <link;drill;§o§nMining §o§nDrill§r> by crafting them together.

#グラファイト(Graphite)
ie.manual.entry.graphite.name=グラファイト
ie.manual.entry.graphite.subtext=Coal stuff

ie.manual.entry.graphite0=Highly Ordered Pyrolytic Graphite (HOP) is a complex, highly compressed, carbon material used in special engineering constructs.<br>HOP Graphite Dust is created by compressing eight pieces of Coke Dust in the <link;biodiesel;§o§nIndustrial §o§nSqueezer§r;1>. That dust can then be smelted into an ingot.
ie.manual.entry.graphite1=The most common use for HOP Graphite is the creation of electrodes to be used in the <link;arcfurnace;§o§nArc §o§nFurnace§r>. These electrodes are created with an <link;blueprints;§o§nEngineer's §o§nBlueprint§r>, which you can<config;b;arcfurnace_electrodeCrafting; craft,> find in certain chests or trade with a villager.

#基本的な配線(Basic Wiring)
ie.manual.entry.wiring.name=基本的な配線
ie.manual.entry.wiring.subtext=Bzzzt!

ie.manual.entry.wiring0=The energy-net of Immersive Engineering has four important blocks: §lCapacitors§r to store energy, §lconnectors§r as inputs and outputs for the net, §lrelays§r to connect wires together and §ltransformers§r to switch between different levels of wire.<br>In low- and medium-voltage systems (copper and electrum wires), connectors and relays are the same block, but high-voltage connectors will only ever accept one wire.
ie.manual.entry.wiring1=To connect two blocks, simply click the first one with a wire coil, then use the same coil on the second block. The total transferrate between two points depends on the weakest type of wire between them.
ie.manual.entry.wiring2=Note that restrictions apply based on blocks: Connectors and relays will only take wires of the same type that is already connected, transformers will only take two wires of a different type,<br>[cont]
ie.manual.entry.wiring3=and wires can only connect to blocks that match the voltage.

ie.manual.entry.wiringConnector=§lConnectors§r serve as in- and outputs to the IE Energy-Net. You can place them on capacitors or other RF handlers and they will transfer power through connected wires. HV Relays will still accept wires but can't in- or output, they serve as connection points between wires.

ie.manual.entry.wiringCapacitor=§lCapacitors§r serve as energy storage units. You can use the hammer to adjust the configuration of each side, with blue designating an input, orange an output and no colour marking preventing any connection at all. Sneak while using the hammer to configure the side opposite of the one you clicked.

ie.manual.entry.wiringTransformer0=§lTransformers§r allow you to transition between different types of wire. The weakest wire restricts the transfer rate. Note that HV Transformers can step down to LV or MV, so you do not need to chain two transformers.
ie.manual.entry.wiringTransformer1=You can attach <link;wiring;§o§ntransformers §o§nto §o§nwooden §o§npoles§r;3> as shown on the second image on page 4, however only non-HV Transformers can be placed like this.

ie.manual.entry.wiringCutters=The §lWire Cutters§r are used to removed all the wires connected to a block by simply rightclicking it.

ie.manual.entry.wiringVoltmeter=The §lVoltmeter§r is used to measure connections. Rightclick a capacitor to read its current storage or sneak+rightclick two connectors to calculate the average loss between them.

#発電(Power Generation)
ie.manual.entry.generator.name=発電
ie.manual.entry.generator.subtext=

ie.manual.entry.generator0=Transferring power is quite helpful provided you have power. To actually generate RF, you can use the kinetic forces of windmills and waterwheels. Connecting these to a dynamo will generate power based on how fast they turn.

ie.manual.entry.generatorWindmill=The Windmill is a free and easy way of generating power, albeit not a very powerful one. Its speed depends greatly on how high it is placed in the world and how obscured the space in front of it is. It will also run faster when it's raining or storming.

ie.manual.entry.generatorWatermill=The Water Wheel is a fairly easy way of powering a dynamo. It's turning speed is based on the water flowing around it, so for optimal results, you'll want to direct the water in a semi-circle from the top down one side and along the bottom. Up to three water wheels can be placed against each other.

ie.manual.entry.generatorWindmillImproved=The improved Windmill is an upgrade to the windmills. While it has twice the output it's also more pricey to create, requiring tough fabric made from industrial hemp. Break tall grass to aquire hemp seeds.

#ブレーカースイッチ(Breaker Switch)
ie.manual.entry.breaker.name=ブレーカースイッチ
ie.manual.entry.breaker.subtext=Clap on - Clap off

ie.manual.entry.breaker0=Breaker Switches are simply switches that can stop the flow of power through wires. They can connect two wires of the same type and will only allow power to pass when activated. This can be used to seperate power-hungry machinery from the network or hook up an additional set of generators when needed!
ie.manual.entry.breaker1=These breaker switches will emit a redstone signal when they are switched on; this behaviour can be inverted by clicking the switch with an Engineer's Hammer.
#When lights are added, these switches have another use ;D

#モニタリング変圧器(Current Transformer)
ie.manual.entry.eMeter.name=モニタリング変圧器
ie.manual.entry.eMeter.subtext=88 Flux per hour!
ie.manual.entry.eMeter0=The Current Transformer is a measurement device for electrical power. It can be hooked up in any powerline and will keep track of energy transferred through it, returning an average RF/t upon rightclick.

#マニュアルｰ>エネルギー、導線、発電>熱電発電機(Thermoelectric Generator)
ie.manual.entry.thermoElectric.name=熱電発電機
ie.manual.entry.thermoElectric.subtext=Hot and Cold

ie.manual.entry.thermoElectric0=Thermoelectric Generators are another option of power generation and work without the use of any mechanical parts, instead they use the temperature gradients between two sources.
ie.manual.entry.thermoElectric1=Placing a hot fluid on one side and a colder fluid on the opposing side generates energy based on the difference between the two temperatures.<br>The following list contains other, non-fluid, blocks, which can be used as sources of temperature.

#マニュアル>概要と材料>高炉(Blast Furnace)
ie.manual.entry.blastfurnace.name=高炉
ie.manual.entry.blastfurnace.subtext=Even hotter topic!

ie.manual.entry.blastfurnace0=The Blast Furnace is used to increase the carbon contents in iron, turning it into steel. To achieve this, only pure, high-carbon fuels may be used for the furnace, specifically coal coke and charcoal.<br>The steel created in the blast furnace is an integral part of high-voltage architecture.

ie.manual.entry.metalconstruction0=Apart from Treated Wood, processed metals make for common construction blocks. You can craft almost any metal into blocks and slabs, or hammer iron ingots into a sheetmetal block.
ie.manual.entry.metalconstruction1=Steel is not only an integral part of high-voltage architectures, it is also quite useful in, well, architecture. Steel scaffolding can be used to quickly create climbable structures, steel fencing keeps baddies at bay and structural arms make for great attachment points for your HV relays.
ie.manual.entry.metalconstruction2=Structural Connectors work similarly to normal connectors, but instead of transferring energy, they are purely decorative.<br>They won't accept normal wires, but Hemp Rope and Steel Cable (see next page).<br>You can also rotate them by rightclicking them with an Engineer's Hammer.

#技術的な灯火(Engineered Lighting)
ie.manual.entry.lighting.name=技術的な灯火
ie.manual.entry.lighting.subtext=Lighting up the Wasteland
ie.manual.entry.lighting0=Deep in the halls of the factories, it can be quite dark. In order to still find your way around the machines, you should probably light up the place with some Lanterns. These Lanterns provide as much light as a glowstone block would.
ie.manual.entry.lighting1=Powered Lanterns are one of the first ever invented uses for electric power. To run these, you need to connect them directly to your power grid using wires. They will allow power to be transferred through them, so you can link them in a row.
ie.manual.entry.lighting2=As long as they are supplied with a little bit of power, they will light up the surrounding area like a normal Lantern, but additionally, they will also prevent hostile mobs to spawn in a 32 block radius!
ie.manual.entry.lighting3=Floodlights are strong lightsources. While they require more power than a simple Powered Lantern, they will create a cone of light up to 32 blocks long. Use an Engineer's Hammer on the top or bottom faces of the block to rotate the light or click its sides to change its pitch.

#タンクとサイロ(Tanks and Silos)

#マニュアルｰ>エネルギー、導線、発電ｰ>高圧(High-Voltage)
ie.manual.entry.highvoltage.name=高圧
ie.manual.entry.highvoltage.subtext=You can't shake the shock

ie.manual.entry.highvoltage0=High-Voltage wires have the highest available transfer rate (<config;iA;cableTransferRate;2> RF/t) and will need special connectors. Note that on High voltage connections, §oConnectors and Relays are different blocks§r, Relays will not be able to in- or output to the energy net. Furthermore, §oRelays can only be placed on the underside of the block.§r<br>To transition from HV to LV or MV connections, you will need High-Voltage Transformers, and keep in mind, the lowest tier of wire limits the transferrate of an entire connection.

#マニュアルｰ>概要と材料ｰ>マルチブロック(Multiblock Constructions)
ie.manual.entry.multiblocks.name=マルチブロック
ie.manual.entry.multiblocks.subtext=Where's my Allen Wrench?

ie.manual.entry.multiblocks0=Fitting complex machinery into a single 1x1x1 cube seems to be a task unmanageable without the use of magic or possibly shrink rays.

#マニュアルｰ>エネルギー、導線、発電ｰ>ディーゼル発電機(Diesel Generator)
ie.manual.entry.dieselgen.name=ディーゼル発電機
ie.manual.entry.dieselgen.subtext=Better than volume: More volume.

ie.manual.entry.dieselgen0=High-Voltage architecture might be fascinating, but it's not very useful unless you have a generator that can actually create the required output for it.<br>The Diesel Generator is one of the few ways of generating this sort of energy. It is created as a complex multiblock structure and will run off of <link;biodiesel;§o§nBiodiesel§r> or other types of combustible fuel. Due to its high output, it will work through fuel very quickly, so make sure you have a sufficient fuel production to run it.
ie.manual.entry.dieselgen1=The structure is built from Engine, Generator and Radiator blocks. Arrange them in the shape shown on the following side and hit either the central generator or central radiator with an Engineer's Hammer.
ie.manual.entry.dieselgen2=Fuel is to be input at the bottom corners of the generator, whereas energy will be output to up to three connection on the top.

ie.manual.entry.dieselgen3=The following table lists all valid fuels for the Diesel Generator and for how long in seconds (ticks) they burn.

#マニュアルｰ>概要と材料ｰ>バイオ燃料(Biodiesel)
ie.manual.entry.biodiesel.name=バイオ燃料
ie.manual.entry.biodiesel.subtext=Green power!

ie.manual.entry.biodiesel0=Combustible fuels are an easy to use and efficient fuel source. But with oil being a depletable resource, something renewable would be much preferable. Biodiesel is the solution! By combining plant oil and ethanol, you can create a combustible fluid that will burn in the <link;dieselgen;§o§nDiesel §o§nGenerator§r>.
ie.manual.entry.biodiesel1=Plant Oil is created by processing various seeds in the industrial squeezer. Create the structure pictured above and click one of the sides with an Engineer's Hammer to form it. Power is input at the top or bottom, fluids are output through any of the ports at the bottom of each side.

ie.manual.entry.biodiesel2=Ethanol is gained by fermenting sugarcane. The fermenter's structure is created in a similar manner to that of the squeezer, as such power in- and fluid outputs are identical.
ie.manual.entry.biodiesel2T=The following list shows various items that can be fermented into ethanol, and the amount they produce.
ie.manual.entry.biodiesel3=Lastly, in order to refine plant oil and ethanol into Biodiesel, you will need to insert both fluids into a refinery and supply it with power. The structure is created as shown above and formed by clicking the center of the front with an Engineer's Hammer.
ie.manual.entry.biodiesel4=The front of the refinery serves as fluid output, whereas the inputs are found on the smaller sides. Energy is supplied through the connector at the back. Applying a redstone signal to the control panel on the right will halt the refinery's process.

#マニュアルｰ>工具と機械ｰ>ベルトコンベア(Conveyor Belts)
ie.manual.entry.conveyor.name=ベルトコンベア
ie.manual.entry.conveyor.subtext=Who needs rails anyway?

ie.manual.entry.conveyor0=Conveyor Belts are an easy way of transporting all sorts of things around your base. While they are strong enough to move living creatures like cows or sheep, their true strength lies in transporting items.<br>Throwing items atop them will have the items move along the belt. Should the belt lead into an inventory, the item will be inserted.
ie.manual.entry.conveyor1=Blocks like hoppers will be able to drop items onto the belts. Use an Engineer's Hammer to rotate the belts (rightclick) or adjust whether they should run up- or downwards (sneak + rightclick).<br>By default, conveyors face the same way the player is facing. Sneaking while placing them will instead make them face towards the player.
ie.manual.entry.conveyor2=The Dropping Conveyor Belt is quite simply a conveyor with a hatch in the middle, allowing it to drop items that pass over it downwards.<br>Items will be inserted into inventories below or simply dropped if there is an empty space below the conveyor.

#マニュアルｰ>工具と機械ｰ>発熱機(External Heater)
ie.manual.entry.furnaceHeater.name=発熱機
ie.manual.entry.furnaceHeater.subtext=Now you're cooking with flux!

ie.manual.entry.furnaceHeater0=The External Heater does exactly what its name implies, it generates thermal energy from RF. When placed next to a normal furnace, this thermal energy will power the furnace, allowing it to smelt without any fuel inside it.
ie.manual.entry.furnaceHeater1=Click a side of the heater with a hammer to make it an energy acceptor, sneak to target the opposing side.<br>The heater will consume §o<config;i;heater_consumption> RF/t§r for each heat unit added. During the initial phase of the furnace, the heater will produce up to §o4§r units of heat per tick, but as soon as the furnace reaches maximum temperature, it will only require §o1§r unit of heat to keep it going.
ie.manual.entry.furnaceHeater2=Even better, while the furnace is at maximum temperature, the heater will consume an additional §o<config;i;heater_speedupConsumption> RF/t§r to increase the furnace's processing speed.<br>The heater will only affect a furnace with a valid input and space in the output slot, in order to conserve energy. However, you can apply a redstone signal to the heater to disable that functionality and have it keep the furnace at full heat.

#液体の輸送(Fluid Transport)
ie.manual.entry.fluidPipes.name=液体の輸送
ie.manual.entry.fluidPipes.subtext=Professional Plumber
ie.manual.entry.fluidPipes0=Transporting fluids has become quite essential in the engineering business. Fluid Pipes and Fluid Pumps do exactly that. On their own, Fluid Pipes are quite slow at transferring fluids, but if a pump is used to insert the fluid, it'll move much faster.
ie.manual.entry.fluidPipes1=You can rightclick the connection piece of a pipe with an Engineer's Hammer to prevent it from connecting to that side.<br>Fluid Pipes can be covered with wooden or steel scaffolding. Simply rightclick a piece of scaffolding onto a pipe to cover it. Break the pipe to retrieve the scaffolding.
ie.manual.entry.fluidPipes2=Fluid Pumps have three essential functions. They can be used to insert into pipes at high pressure, to transfer fluids much faster, or they can pick up fluids from the world. Using your hammer on the base of the pump will switch the sides between in- and output.
ie.manual.entry.fluidPipes3=In order for the pump to pick up fluid blocks, it will need a power input at the top and a redstone signal. Pumps can also be used to extract from tanks and other fluid containers that do not have an automatic output. This will also require a redstone signal, but won't consume power.
ie.manual.entry.fluidPipes4=<config;b;pump_infiniteWater;Water blocks will serve as an infinite fluid source for the pump, as long as more than 3 blocks are connected.<br><br>;><config;b;pump_placeCobble;Fluid blocks that were picked up will be replaced with cobblestone to reduce the lag of flowing fluids.

ie.manual.entry.drill1=The Drill Head determines the base mining level, speed, and size, as well as the attack damage. As you dig blocks, the drill head takes damage, but it can be repaired in an anvil.

ie.manual.entry.drill2=As the drill is powered by a combustion engine, it will not run underwater unless you equip it with the Internal Oxidizer Tank Upgrade. However, with this upgrade equipped, it will not only run while submerged, but also ignore the slowdown usually experienced when digging in water.

ie.manual.entry.drill3=The Advanced Lubrication System applies additional lubricant to the drill at a regular basis, allowing it to run and dig faster.

ie.manual.entry.drill4=By adding Additional Augers to the drill, it's destructive potential against living creatures is increased. The upgrade stacks up to three and each will add an additional point of attack damage.

ie.manual.entry.lightningrod0=Lightning is a phenomenon of nature. It contains a huge amount of raw power, and this lightning rod is able to harness that power.<br>By stacking a lot of steel fences on this multiblock, you increase the chance of a lightning bolt striking it during rain or thunderstorms.
ie.manual.entry.lightningrod1=When the steel pole is struck, the huge amounts of energy created are stored in the base of the lightning rod and is then slowly distributed to energy connections at the sides.<br><br>The structure is created as shown above, and formed by clicking the central block with an Engineer's Hammer.
ie.manual.entry.lightningrod2=You can improve the chances of the Lightning Rod getting struck by creating a "net" of steel fences connected to the topmost fence.

#マニュアルｰ>概要と材料ｰ>鉱床(Mineral Deposits)
ie.manual.entry.minerals.name=鉱床
ie.manual.entry.minerals.subtext=Oresome

ie.manual.entry.minerals0=The deposits of Ore found around your world are nothing new to you. What have so far left out of consideration though are mineral veins, which contain a mix of different ores. Due to their wide and thin spread, the average miner can't find them, but a <link;excavator;§o§nspecial §o§nmachine§r> might be able to assist with that.
ie.manual.entry.minerals1=To find and determine minerals in the world, you will want to craft a Core Sample Drill. This machine, when powered, will drill into the chunk and determine which mineral can be found there. The Drill consumes <config;i;coredrill_consumption> RF/t and takes <config;i;coredrill_time> ticks to fully retrieve and analyze a sample.
ie.manual.entry.minerals2=The following pages list every type of vein and the ores that can be retrieved from them.

ie.manual.entry.mineralsDimValid=§l%1$s§r is a mineral vein that can be found in the %2$s.
ie.manual.entry.mineralsDimInvalid=§l%1$s§r is a mineral vein that can be found anywhere but in the %2$s.
ie.manual.entry.mineralsDimAny=§l%1$s§r is a mineral vein that can be found in any Dimension.

#マニュアルｰ>工具と機械ｰ>アーク炉(Arc Furnace)
ie.manual.entry.arcfurnace.name=アーク炉
ie.manual.entry.arcfurnace.subtext=Not a reactor

ie.manual.entry.arcfurnace0=The Arc Furnace is a massive structure used to quickly smelt metals. It consists of a steel vat topped by electrodes which heat up the metal.
ie.manual.entry.arcfurnace1=The furnace excels at smelting ores and creating steel due to its high speed and its abiltiy to process multiple items at the same time, but it is also complex in its workings and will require maintenance in order to coninue functioning.<br>Slag must be removed from the machine or it will cease to function, and degrading electrodes need to be replaced over time.
ie.manual.entry.arcfurnace2=To form the structure, assemble it as shown on the first page, then click the cauldron with an Engineer's Hammer.<br><br>Energy is input through the three connectors at the back, and supplying the controlpanel at the front with a redstone signal will turn off the machine. Right-clicking the panel, 'bucket' or vat will open the interface.
ie.manual.entry.arcfurnace3=§lInterface:§r<br>The interface may look confusing upon first seeing it, but it's quite straight forward.<br><br>The three slots at the top are for the <link;graphite;§o§nGraphite §o§nElectrodes§r;1>.<br>Electrodes can be inserted into the furnace through the top-center block of the structre.<br>The twelve slots on the left are the input slots for metals and ores. Each slot has a temperature bar next to it, representing the progress of smelting.
ie.manual.entry.arcfurnace4=The four slots on the right are for "additives", different materials added to the molten metal during the crafting process. An example of these would be adding Coke Dust to melting Iron in order to create Steel.<br>Inputs and additives are inserted through the two hatches at the top of the structure, to the left and right of the electrodes.
ie.manual.entry.arcfurnace5=The seven slots at the bottom are six output slots and a slot for slag. Outputs are retrieved from the 'bucket' at the front of the structure, slag through the port at the back of the machine. The Arc Furance will automatically push output and slag to connected inventories (this includes Conveyor Belts).

#マニュアルｰ>工具と機械ｰ>掘削機(Excavator)
ie.manual.entry.excavator.name=掘削機
ie.manual.entry.excavator.subtext=Better than Dwarves

ie.manual.entry.excavator0=The Excavator is one of the pinnacles of modern engineering. It is able to dig up <link;minerals;§o§nminerals§r;0> from veins inaccessible by normal mining. In return however, the excavator is a complex structure which requires <config;i;excavator_consumption> RF/t in order to operate.
ie.manual.entry.excavator1=The structure is comprised of two pieces: The engine shown on the first page and the bucket wheel displayed on the second, which fits into the 'braces' of the engine as displayed on the previous page. The energy input for the engine is on its side, the back features a redstone control panel and the item output.<br>As the excavator digs up ores, the yield of the vein slowly decreases, but a vein of minerals can last for <config;i;excavator_depletion_days> days of consecutive digging.
